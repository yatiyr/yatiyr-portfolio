# yatiyr-portfolio

In other project, I was learning how to use api's and connect to databases and fetch data from those places. But I also want to build a customized, modern looking blog website. So here, I also started learning Chakra-UI.

This work is on progress. I will implement functionalities after I finish frontend parts. It will be much easier that way.

## Portfolio App

This project is right now deployed on my instance in aws. It can be seen by navigating to [here](http://3.67.97.88:3000/).
Both api and frontend are running on that instance.

Here are some gifs of the pages of my portfolio app
