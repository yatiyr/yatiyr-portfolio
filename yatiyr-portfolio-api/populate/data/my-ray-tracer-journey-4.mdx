## Overview

In this project, we had to implement;

- Transformations
- Instancing
- Multisampling
- Depth of Field
- Area Lights
- Motion Blur
- Glossy Reflections

I’m delivering this part in OdtuClass today (10/05/2021) because I could not debug
some problems that I was facing. I didn’t want to publish an unfinished
work so I tried to debug them all night. They were very silly mistakes
which I’m going to explain shortly.

## Transformations

Firstly we had to implement transformations. We have three different transformation types;

- Translation
- Rotation
- Scaling

Just like we saw in class and in Ceng477, these transformations are described with 4×4
matrices. And in order to implement a sequence of transformations, we just multiply
them from right to left.

<br/>

I had to do a minor refactoring to implement transformations on scene objects. Until
now, I was dealing with **triangles**, **spheres** and **meshes** without any OOP concepts. So
firstly, I created a Base Object class and stored three matrices and a virtual
function like this(of course I’m simplifying the code a little bit);

<br/>

```cpp:Object class
class Object
{
public:
    glm::mat4 transformationMatrix;
    glm::mat4 transformationMatrixInversed;
    glm::mat4 transformationMatrixInverseTransposed;

    virtual bool Intersect() = 0;

};
```
<br/>

So, why I’m storing **transformationMatrixInversed** and **transformationMatrixInverseTransposed**?

<br/>

When testing for intersections, I do not transform object vertices or objects into world
coordinates. Instead, I’m transforming the ray to local coordinates of the object.
In order to do this, I transform the ray using inversed version of transformation
matrix.

<br/>

Secondly, I also need to transform normals for light calculations or reflections.
I had two choices here;

<br/>

- Transform lights to local coordinates
- Transform normals to world coordinates

<br/>

I liked the second option more and transformed the normal vectors of intersections to world coordinates.
For that, I’ve used inverse transpose of transformation matrix.

<br/>

After arrangements, I had my first results;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="simple_transform" src="/images/simple_transform.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="simple_transform.png"/>
<br/>

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="ellipsoids" src="/images/ellipsoids.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="ellipsoids.png"/>
<br/>

According to this result, I assumed that I had correctly implemented transformations and moved on to the next step, **Instancing**.

## Instancing

Just like we’ve learned in class, we need instancing to save some memory. We can
use same objects and just by instancing create multiple versions of them and
put them into different positions and change their orientations with
different transformations without allocating more memory. That’s
the point of instancing as far as I’ve understood.

<br/>

I’ve created a new child class of **Object** which is **MeshInstance**. Mesh instance
behaves just hold a pointer to the **Mesh** object and uses its data for
intersection computations. I don’t want to give my results about
instancing here because they are being used with different techniques
which I’m going to explain after this part. So my implementation can
be seen in those parts

## Multisampling

Multisampling is for increasing the accuracy and quality of the results.
And it also makes it easier for us to implement some visual effects.
What I did was dividing each pixel that I’m going to process into
**N** uniform parts and create rays for each of them. So I’ve
implemented **jittered sampling**. But here, I had to create
random numbers. I also saw that I’ll need a lot more random
variables later, I created a random number generator class;

<br/>

```cpp:RandomGenerator
class RandomGenerator
{
private:
    float rangeFrom;
    float rangeTo;
    std::random_device randomDevice;
    std::mt19937       generator;
    std::uniform_real_distribution<float> distr;

public:
    RandomGenerator(float from, float to)
    {
        rangeFrom = from;
        rangeTo   = to;

        generator = std::mt19937(randomDevice());
        distr     = std::uniform_real_distribution<float>(rangeFrom, rangeTo);
    }

    float Generate()
    {
        return distr(generator);
    }
    
};
```
<br/>

So I’ve used this class for creating random positions on each part inside the pixel.

<br/>

For filtering, I’ve used gaussian filtering. I assigned weight on each created
ray according to its distance to the center of pixel. I’ve created this
utility function to deal with it;

<br/>

```cpp:GaussianWeight
inline float GaussianWeight(float x, float y, float stdDev)
{
    return (1/(2*M_PI*stdDev*stdDev)) * std::pow(EULER, (-1/2)*((x*x + y*y)/(stdDev*stdDev)));
}
```
<br/>

I also don’t want to share results in this part because I need to explain visual effects first.

## Depth of Field

Finally, after implementing multisampling, I first dived into depth of field part. What I
needed to do was just adding focusDistance and apertureSize variables to the
camera and create random variables for location in the lens.

<br/>

I made use of this while creating primary rays. By using the equations in our slide,
I calculated new rays coming from the lens. This is the result I had;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="spheres dof" src="/images/spheres_dof.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="spheres_dof.png (rendered in 6.33371 seconds – 100 samples)"/>
<br/>

Yes, it is a bit noisier than the correct image. I did not find what I need to do to make it better.
But if I increase sample size to 900;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="spheres dof better" src="/images/spheres_dof-1.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="spheres_dof (rendered in 64.469 seconds – 900 samples)"/>
<br/>

It becomes a little bit better at the cost of being rendered a lot slower.

## Area Lights

I created a new light structure for area lights. Area lights are used to create soft shadows.
In area lights, we make an orthonormal basis(I make it in constructor of area light
since we don’t transform it) using the normal vector. We also calculate random
positions in the surface of area light and use it as the light.

<br/>

Secondly, we don’t use intensity just like we do in point light. We do a different
calculation for irradiance. We need to take;

- vector from intersection point in object surface to random position in area light surface and area light surface normal and cosine of the angle between them
- radiance value of area light
- area value of the light
- distance between random position in light and intersection point

<br/>

While computing the cosine value of that angle that I’ve mentioned above, we need to take its absolute value because if we don’t,
light will not illuminate other side of the area light.

<br/>

Here, I had a really annoying problem. That’s it;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox area error" src="/images/cornellbox_area_error.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="cornellbox area wrong"/>
<br/>

You see that spheres look ok but there is a problem in ceiling. I was actually thinking about delivering this part of the project
yesterday but solving this problem took nearly 3-4 hours.

<br/>

The problem was not about my area light implementation or calculations, problem came
from my filtering code. The problem was I was clamping pixel values between 0.0
and 1.0(I don’t use 8 bit unsigned integers, I use floating numbers between 0
and 1) when computing pixel of traced ray. But this was creating a problem
while taking weighted average coming from different samples. So, I stopped
clamping it in raytracing function and clamped the pixel **after** filtering
operation. This corrected the problem;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox area" src="/images/cornellbox_area.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="cornellbox_area.png (rendered in 11.9647s – 100 samples)"/>
<br/>

Again it is a bit noisier than the example, but it becomes a lot better if we increase sample number to 900 😀

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox area better" src="/images/cornellbox_area_better.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="cornellbox_area.png (rendered in 103.478s – 900 samples)"/>
<br/>

## Motion Blur

In this part, we are making use of transformations and random variables between 0.0 and 1.0. For simplicity
we only had to implement translations. I gave a random **time** variable between 0.0 and 1.0 to each sample
ray and when calculating intersections, I translated moving objects according to the time.

<br/>

Here are the results;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox boxes dynamic" src="/images/cornellbox_boxes_dynamic.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="cornellbox_boxes_dynamic.png (rendered in 75.7427 seconds – 900 samples)"/>
<br/>

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="dragon dynamic" src="/images/dragon_dynamic.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="dragon_dynamic.png (rendered in 148.609s – 100 samples)"/>
<br/>

These pictures also show that my instancing implementation is correct. By the way green dragon looks like a jelly, I really liked it :D.

## Glossy Reflections

Lastly, I had to implement glossy reflections. It is for simulating imperfect reflections.
Again I used random variables, created an orthonormal basis with reflected ray direction
and changed the direction of the reflected ray using the vectors I obtained while
creating the orthonormal basis.

<br/>

I made use of **roughness** parameter here for determining how strong imperfect reflections
are. This parameter only applies for mirror and conductor type of materials. Here are
my results;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox brushed metal" src="/images/cornellbox_brushed_metal.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="cornellbox_brushed_metal.png (rendered in 35.3315 seconds – 400 samples)"/>
<br/>

These balls look like the ones they put onto pine trees.

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="metal glass plates" src="/images/metal_glass_plates.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="metal_glass_plates.png (rendered in 10.6414 seconds – 36 samples)"/>
<br/>

## Debugging Process

I could not obtain these images above easily. I struggled and panicked a lot :D. I recorded some of my bad results. For example, in **cornellbox_boxes_dynamic** image, I was getting this;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox boxes dynamic 3" src="/images/cornellbox_boxes_dynamic3.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="cornellbox_boxes_dynamic.png"/>
<br/>

I sat down and started thinking why I get this image. During this process, I have learned a way to debug image errors. It may or may not be a good way but It helped me a lot. I may learn better ways
in the future since I’m a beginner right now :D.

<br/>

So, what I do when I get wrong images?

- I start removing suspicious objects from the scene. Maybe I can understand what causes the problem
- Play around with xml a litle bit more
- Do I parse xml file correctly?
- Are my calculations correct?
- If everything seems correct, then I first make calculations on paper and trace specific rays with gdb.

I really hate the last option. It is hard for me so I don’t bother dealing with gdb first.
Trying other options before this one is better.

<br/>

For example for the above image, instead of starting hard debugging process, I just
started removing some objects and got this;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox boxes dynamic-1" src="/images/cornellbox_boxes_dynamic-1.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="wrong cube"/>
<br/>

I have a cube but it looks weird. So there is another problem here. By looking at the cube, I saw that it only renders half of the faces of the cube.

<br/>

So there is a problem in parsing ply files. But where? Since ply file of cube is not huge,
I looked at it in text editor and saw that in the file, faces have 4 points instead of
3. But in my ply parsing code, I just assumed that faces can only be triangles. So
added parsing code for faces having 4 points and;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox boxes dynamic2" src="/images/cornellbox_boxes_dynamic2.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="correct cube"/>
<br/>

I got this image above. By the way I also deleted some transformations applied on the cube thats why it is not rotated. So I solved a problem on the way. But
why I’m getting the first picture (a gray illuminated plane).

<br/>

This time, I restored the xml file and started playing with faces of meshes and I got this image;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="cornellbox boxes dynamic4" src="/images/cornellbox_boxes_dynamic4.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="another image"/>
<br/>

So it seems that one plane is blocking our sight. This must mean that we should not render this plane at all while looking from here. I had some “educated” guesses about the solution but in order to be sure, I examined
vertex position of the faces of that particular plane.

<br/>

Yeah, vertices are in clockwise order. So surface normal of the plane points away from us. This means that this image want us to implement **backface culling**.

<br/>

So, I implemented backface culling and disabled it for dielectrics(for obvious reasons) and it worked.

<br/>

From the image we can see that cube on the left is not yellow, so there is a problem while assigning material to mesh instance (good guess, corrected).

<br/>

And also if you look at the reflections on the rightmost cube, you can see that it is not
correct too. So this means there might be a problem while translating surface normals
since we need them to create reflected rays (good guess, corrected)

<br/>

I do not want to use extra effort for nothing. If I dived into gdb quickly, I could
not understand all these problems that fast. That’s my approach for handling errors.
Maybe it is not the best way but it helped me a lot. I got a lot more errors then the
ones I’ve mentioned but this blog is going to be really long if I try to explain all
of them. But they are all similar.

## Conclusion

Another part is finished. I’m happy with the results. Quality of my images are a lot better and of course they are rendered a lot slower. I’ve learned a lot
of things. Especially I think my problem solving skills are increasing as well.
