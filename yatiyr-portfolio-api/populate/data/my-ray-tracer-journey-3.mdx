## Overview

In this two weeks, I was trying to implement a BVH tree with GLSL shaders.
And then, I was going to implement recursive ray tracing (I failed :D). I
immediately initiated another RayTracer project which runs on CPU. My CPU
project runs a lot faster than GPU implementation. This proves that I need
to learn a lot more things related to shader programming.

<br/>

I will mainly work on CPU part from now on. I will consider GPU part for the
project part of the course. Learning concepts and implementing them comfortably
is more important.

<br/>

Within 3 late days, I have managed to implement the things related to HW2 and
I will share my comments and thoughts on things that Iâ€™ve encountered in detail.

### Things I Did With GPU

I first want to talk about my experience with compute shaders and the problems that
Iâ€™ve encountered. I really like playing with shaders and I can implement most of the
algorithms that I see with them. I really want to learn how to write clean an efficient
shader code. However, it runs so sloooooowly and I cannot understand why. I guess I need
to be an expert in order to fully understand what were my problems. While I was searching
on the net, I saw people trying to understand what their shader code does by looking at
the assembly codes created by shader compilers.

<br/>

I guess being a newbie shader programmer is not enough for creating optimized shaders.
I need to have a deeper understanding about the inner structure of GPUs. Things were
working great in the beginning especially when I was working on the first homework.
But when recursive algorithms started coming I started having problems.

### GPU Code Does Not Have Recursion

I already knew that I could not implement recursive algorithms like BVH traversal
and recursive ray tracing just like we normally do in CPU side. But I had solutions
in my mind. Since speed was very important for us, I mainly focused on implementing
a BVH traversal algorithm in compute shader.

<br/>

We all have some solutions in our minds for implementing recursive algorithms iteratively.
We use stacks. It is one of the most convenient ways of implementing recursive algorithms
iteratively. So, How I did that in compute shader?

<br/>

For BVH traversal, I implemented a stack

<br/>

```cpp:stack
BVHNode nodeStack[MAX_STACK_LENGTH]
```
<br/>

Here is my pseudo code for traversing the BVH:

<br/>

```cpp:bvh traverse
IntersectionReport intersectBVH(Ray r, Mesh m)
{
    BVHNode rootNode = BVHNodes[mesh.rootBVHNode];
    nodeStack[0] = rootNode;
    int stackPointer = 1;
    BVHNode current = nodeStack[0];
    while(stackPointer >=1)
    {
        // Pop the stack
        stackPointer--
        current = nodeStack[stackPointer];

        bool aabbIntersect = intersectBox(r, current.aabb, tmin, tmax);
        if(aabbIntersect == true)
        {
            // Current node is a leaf
            if(current.isLeaf == true)
            {
                IntersectionReport rprt = intersectFace(r, current.indices, tmin,tmax)
                // Things related to face intersection
                ...
            }
            // If it is not a leaf, we push children into the stack
            else
            {
                nodeStack[stackPointer] = BVHNodes[current.rightNode];
                stackPointer++;
                nodeStack[stackPointer] = BVHNodes[current.leftNode];
                stackPointer++;
            }
        }
    }

    return report;
}
```
<br/>

This algorithm is straightforward. I first flattened the BVH tree that Iâ€™ve constructed
in CPU and sent it to the shader by using **Shader Storage Buffer Objects**. I had a giant
BVHNode array which contains all the nodes coming from all the meshes in the scene. I just
kept their offsets and reached them by using these offsets.

<br/>

However, this **destroyed** the speed gain. Shader started running ridiculously slow.
Especially when tree heights are higher, shader becomes slower and slower. After searching
through the net, I have learnt that checking things with if and else everywhere in the
shader is not a proper approach. Shaders do not like branching because GPU is not created
for these purposes. I needed to have another approach for BVH traversal. Implementing
recursion with stacks is not efficient.

<br/>

I searched for a solution for a week :D. And finally I implemented this algorithm and
it worked better. I flatten the BVH again, but I keep the elements in the array sorted
in pre-order form. Just like how we traverse the BVH tree. For each node, I was keeping
how many child nodes they have.

<br/>

So, my new algorithm was just looping that giant BVH node array and passing one index
if bounding box intersects. Otherwise it jumps to the index of the other child at that
level. This gave better results. But again, it was really really slow.

<br/>

Here are my rendering time results for some scenes;

<br/>

- **Bunny:** 14.719 ms
- **ScienceTree:** 35.859 ms
- **Car:** 115.773 ms
- **Low Poly:** 153.762 ms
- **Tower:** 140.304 ms
- **Windmill:** 114.857 ms
- **Berserker:** 51.798 ms
- **ChineseDragon:** 1201.54 ms

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="chinese_dragon" src="/images/chinese_dragon.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="chinese dragon output"/>
<br/>

So as the tree grows larger. My runtime is not like it is O(logn). It is because I am not capable of writing highly optimized
GPU code for now ðŸ˜¦

<br/>

Here is a picture showing how much time I spend in intersection checking. More time is spent in brighter parts.

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="bvh_science_tree" src="/images/bvh_sciencetree.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="bvh science tree"/>
<br/>

So, I dealt with BVH like that. After that, I started implementing recursive ray tracing. But how :D? Branching is a big sin.
Stacks are highly inefficient. How should I do that. Again, only solution came into my mind was again implementing stacks. But
here I could only make mirrors unfortunately. Dielectrics were really really hard to implement in GPU.

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="sciencetreemirror" src="/images/sciencetree_gpu_mirror.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Science Tree with only mirrors enabled. Rendered in 500ms"/>
<br/>

I could not finish this homework with shaders. SaÄŸlÄ±k olsun :D. I will definitely return and clean
the mess I made. But I had to finish my homework. In order to keep up with the class, I needed a
solution. So I started a CPU based ray tracer. My experience with that was truly **Raytracing In One Weekend**.

### CPU Based RayTracer

I initiated another project immediately after I decided that dealing with GPU optimizations taking a lot of time. I moved my Ray Tracing algorithms
in compute shaders to good old C++. Since I am comfortable with C++, I moved faster.

<br/>

I first rendered our hw1 images starting from simple.xml. Had a some minor errors and I resolved them thanks to GDB. After I saw that
I correctly produce the results. I moved on hw2 related topics.

<br/>

I implemented the BVH tree without flattening. I used the traversal algorithm in our slides. I
have used midpoint heuristics for splitting. I searched for some good and efficient ray-box
intersection algorithms and found some on the internet. I guess that made my BVH traversal
run faster. Furthermore, I also implemented the parallelism with C++ 11 features.

<br/>

### Parallelism

I searched on the internet for efficient parallelism in RayTracing and saw some codes in stackoverflow,
github etc. I also read blog posts of the classmates and tried to understand their approaches. After
all, I learned that I need to asynchronously process every pixel with N number of threads where N
is the number of cores in CPU. Here is the parallel technique I use. (I simplified the code a little bit):

<br/>

```cpp:parallelism with future
std::atomic<int> count(0);
std::vector<std::future<void> futureVector;
int cores = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
while(cores--)
{
    futureVector.pushBack(std::async(std::launch::async, [=]()
    {
        while(true)
        {
            int index = count++;
            if(index >= worksize)
                break;

            vec2 coords = GiveCoords(index, _imageWidth);
            Ray primaryRay = ComputePrimaryRay(index, _imageWidth);
            vec3 pixel = RayTrace(primaryRay);
            WritePixelCoord(coords.x, coords.y, pixel);
        }


    }));
}

for(auto& element: futureVector)
{
    element.get();
}
```

<br/>

I saw this pattern of code which uses future and async in a lot of places.
By using parallelism and BVH trees, I was ready for calculating the times.

<br/>

Low poly images gave great results. But chinese_dragon frustrated me a little bit.
It was rendering it in 2 seconds while rendering others in 70 â€“ 300 ms. Something
was wrong. And I saw the problem after thinking for a day. I was just limiting the
depth of my tree as 10. It was slow because of that. That tree depth was enough for
small meshes but for large meshes, I needed deeper trees.

<br/>

After I increased the depth limit. I got really fast results which shocked me.

### Some Errors

Of course I had a lot of errors. For example;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="chinese_dragon_error" src="/images/chinese_dragon_error.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="weird dragon"/>
<br/>

I was trying to implement multithreaded rendering and getting this result.
I was using index counter as std::atomic<int\>
but it was not syncronized for some reason. But From that
image, we can see that threads spend a lot less time when not
hitting bounding boxes of dragonâ€™s BVH. Another result like this;

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="sciencetree_error" src="/images/sciencetree_error.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="weird science Tree"/>
<br/>

When handling dielectrics, I was hitting my head to the desk. I was getting
close results to correct images but it was a little bit different. You can
see that glass science tree is not correct. This panicked me a lot because
it was already 20.00 PM and after 23.59, I was not allowed to resubmit my
work in Odtuclass.

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="sciencetree_corrected" src="/images/sciencetree_corrected.gif" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="error corrected"/>
<br/>

I found my mistake. It was really silly. While checking total reflection,
I was calculating cosPhi as usual. But when calculating transmitted rays,
I was just taking square root of cosPhi. This was the reason of my wrong
results. I corrected it and everything worked smoothly after that.

<br/>

### Rendering Results

I am happy with my BVH implementation since it runs a lot faster than I've expected.
Here are some rendering results for images specific to HW2

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="other_dragon" src="/images/other_dragon.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="other dragon"/>
<br/>

### Conclusion

I panicked a lot in while implementing this homework because I thought that
I was going to be left behind. But I managed to overcome the difficulties and
kept up with my classmates I guess. I learned a good lesson from this. I should
not take risks like that. Learning is more important. I think I will carry on
with CPU implementation because Iâ€™m happy with its speed. But it does not mean
that I will give up learning shader programming :D.
